Task tree
=========

All objects of the framework represent a tree of objects. These object are 
called items.

All items of the tree have common ancestor class ``AbstractItem`` (
:doc:`client reference </refs/client/abstractitem_api>`
/
:doc:`server reference </refs/server/abstractitem_api>`
) and common attributes:.


* ``ID``  - unique in the framework ID of the item
	
* ``owner`` - immediate parent and owner of the item
	
* ``task`` — root of the task tree
	
* ``items`` — list of child items
	
* ``item_type`` — type of the item — one of the following values:

  * "task", 
  * "itms",
  * "tables", 
  * "reports",  
  * "item", 
  * "table", 
  * "report", 
  * "detail"
      
* ``item_name`` — the name of the item that will be used in programming code 
  to get access to the item
	  
* ``item_caption`` — the item name that appears to users

At the root of the tree is the task item. 

The task contains group items. There are three types of groups that have the 
following values of the ``item_type`` attribute:

* "items" - these groups contain items with "item" ``item_type``, that can have 
  associated database table. 
 
* "tables" - such groups also contain items that can have associated database 
  tables, but they can be used to create details for other items (see 
  :doc:`Details <data/details>`
  ). 

* "reports" - these groups contain reports - items with "report" ``item_type``, 
  that are used to create reports.

You can create your own groups.

Items that can have associated database table can own details, that are used to 
store records that belong to a record of the master.

For example the task tree of the 
:doc:`Demo project </intro/demo_project>`
is::

    /demo/
        catalogs/
           customers 
           tracks
           albums
           artists
           genres
           media_types
        journals/
            invoices/
                invoice_table
        tables/
            invoice_table
        reports/
            invoice
            purchases_report
            customers_report

At the root of the task tree is a task with the ``item_name`` **demo**. It has
four groups: **catalogs**, **journals**, **tables** and **reports**. The
**catalogs**, **journals** groups have ``item_type`` "items". The items they own
are wrappers over the corresponding database tables. There is one table with 
``tem_name`` **invoice_table**, that also has it's own database table, and three 
reports in the **reports** group.

The **invoices** journal has the **invoice_table** detail, which keeps a list 
of tracks in an customer's invoice. So there are two items with the same name 
"invoice_table" (table and detail). They share the same database table. 

Every item is an attribute of its owner and all items, tables and reports are 
attibutes the task as well (they all have a unique ``item_name``). 

Jam.py is an event driven framework. Each event has, as a parameter, an item (or field)
that triggered the event. For example (on the client):

.. code-block:: js

    function on_after_append(item) {
    }

Knowing this item, we can get access to any item of the task tree. For example to
get access to the **customers** catalog we can write

.. code-block:: js

    item.task.catalogs.customers

or just

.. code-block:: js

    item.task.customers

The hierarchical structure of the project is one of the bases of the DRY 
(don't repeat yourself) principle of the framework. 

For example, some methods of the items, when executed, successively generate 
events for the task, group and the item.

This way we can define a basic behavior for all items in the event handler of 
the task, than can be expanded in then event handler of the group, and finally, 
if nessesary, can be specified in the event handler of the item itself. For more 
details see
:doc:`Working with view forms <interface/view_forms>`.
