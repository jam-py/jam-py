Server side programming
=======================

In most cases, the client sends a request to the server when  following methods 
of an element are executed:

* :doc:`open </refs/client/item/m_open>`
* :doc:`apply </refs/client/item/m_apply>`
* :doc:`print </refs/client/report/m_print>`
* :doc:`server </refs/client/abstr_item/m_server>`

In this case the client sends to the server the 
:doc:`ID </refs/client/abstr_item/at_id>`
of the item's task, the
:doc:`ID </refs/client/abstr_item/at_id>`
item, the type of the request and its parameters.

The server on receiving the request, based on passed IDs, finds the task 
(it can be Project task or Administrator task) and the item on the server, 
executes the corresponing method with passed parameters and returns the result of
the execution to the client. The server method can trigger events that can 
modify its default behavior.

The most common server events are:

.. csv-table:: 
   :header: Event, Description
   :widths: 10, 80

   :doc:`on_created </refs/server/task/on_created>`, "The event is triggered by the task when it has just been created by the server application. It can be used to initialize the project."
   :doc:`on_apply </refs/server/item/on_apply>`, "The event is triggered when the ``apply`` method of the item is called on the :doc:`client </refs/client/item/m_apply>` or the :doc:`server </refs/server/item/m_apply>`"   
   :doc:`on_open </refs/server/item/on_open>`, "The event is triggered when the ``open`` method of the item is called on the :doc:`client </refs/client/item/m_open>` or the :doc:`server </refs/server/item/m_open>`"
   :doc:`on_generate </refs/server/report/on_generate>`, "The event is triggered when the :doc:`print </refs/client/report/m_print>` method of a report is called on the client."

.. note::
    Please do always remember that events triggered by server methods can be 
    executed in parallel threads or processes. Do be very carefull when modifying the 
    attributes of the items of the tasks tree. 
    
    You can use the
    :doc:`copy </refs/server/item/m_copy>`
    method to create a copy of an item. This copy is an exact copy of an item 
    at the time of creating of the task tree. It is not added to the 
    :doc:`task tree </programming/task_tree>`
    and will be destroyed by Python garbage collector when no longer needed. 
    
Example:

.. code-block:: py

    def on_generate(report):
        cust = report.task.customers.copy()
        cust.open()
        report.print_band('title')
        for c in cust:
            firstname = c.firstname.display_text
            lastname = c.lastname.display_text
            company = c.company.display_text
            country = c.country.display_text
            address = c.address.display_text
            phone = c.phone.display_text
            email = c.email.display_text
            report.print_band('detail', locals())
