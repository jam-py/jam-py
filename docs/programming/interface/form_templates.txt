Form templates
==============

Form templates of the project are located in the div with the ``templates`` class
inside the ``body`` tag in the 
:doc:`Index.html <index_html>`
file. 

When 
:doc:`load </refs/client/task/m_load>` 
method is executed, it cuts out the div with ``templates`` class from the 
``body`` and stores it in the
:doc:`templates </refs/client/task/at_templates>`
attribute as a JQuery object.

To add a form template for an item you should add a div with the ``name-suffix``
class in the templates div, where ``name`` is the 
:doc:`item_name </refs/client/abstr_item/at_item_name>`
of the item and ``suffix`` 
is the form type: view, edit, filter, param. 

For example:

.. code-block:: html

	<div class="invoices-edit">
		...
	</div>
	
is an edit form template of the **invoices** item. 

For a detail before its name there should be the name of its master, 
separated by a hyphen: 

.. code-block:: html

	<div class="invoices-invoice_table-edit">
		...
	</div>
	
If an item doesn't have a form template then the form template of its owner, if 
defined, will be used. 

So the template

.. code-block:: html

	<div class="journals-edit">
		...
	</div>

will be used to create edit forms of items that **Journals** group owns and that 
do not have its own edit form template. 

If, after searching this way, no template was found for an item, the template
with the ``default-suffix`` class will 
be used to create a form. 

So the template

.. code-block:: html

	<div class="default-edit">
		...
	</div>

will be used to create edit forms for items that have no templates defined for 
them and their owners.

When a new project is created the index.html already contains such templates.

Below is an example of default edit form template from index.html file:

.. code-block:: html

  <div class="default-edit">
      <div class="form-body">
          <div class="edit-body"></div>
          <div class="edit-detail"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="form-footer">
          <button type="button" id="ok-btn" class="btn expanded-btn">
              <i class="icon-ok"></i> OK<small class="muted">&nbsp;[Ctrl+Enter]</small>
          </button>
          <button type="button" id="cancel-btn" class="btn expanded-btn">
              <i class="icon-remove"></i> Cancel
          </button>
      </div>
  </div>

There are more template examples in the
:doc:`Form exapmles <form_exapmles>`
section.
