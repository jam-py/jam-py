Navigating datasets
===================

Each active dataset has a cursor, or pointer, to the current row in the dataset. 
The current row in a dataset is the one whose values can be manipulated by 
``edit``, ``insert``, and ``delete`` methods, and the one, whose field values, 
data-aware controls on a form currently show.

You can change the current row by moving the cursor to point at a different row. 
The following table lists methods you can use in application code to move to 
different records:

.. csv-table:: 
   :header: Client method, Server method, Description
   :widths: 10, 10, 80

   :doc:`first </refs/client/item/m_first>`, :doc:`first </refs/server/item/m_first>`, "Moves the cursor to the first row in an item dataset."
   :doc:`last </refs/client/item/m_last>`, :doc:`last </refs/server/item/m_last>`, "Moves the cursor to the last row in an item dataset."
   :doc:`next </refs/client/item/m_next>`, :doc:`next </refs/server/item/m_next>`, "Moves the cursor to the next row in an item dataset."
   :doc:`prior </refs/client/item/m_prior>`, :doc:`prior </refs/server/item/m_prior>`, "Moves the cursor to the previous row in an item dataset."


In addition to these methods, the following table describes two methods that 
provide useful information when iterating through the records in a dataset:

.. csv-table:: 
   :header: Client method, Server method, Description
   :widths: 10, 10, 80
   
   :doc:`bof </refs/client/item/m_bof>`, :doc:`bof </refs/server/item/m_bof>`,  "If the method returns true, the cursor is at the first row in the dataset, otherwise, the cursor is not known to be at the first row in the dataset."
   :doc:`eof </refs/client/item/m_eof>`, :doc:`bof </refs/server/item/m_eof>`,  "If the method returns true, the cursor is at the last row in the dataset, otherwise, the cursor is not known to be at the last row in the dataset."

Each time the cursor move to another record in the dataset the following events
are triggered:

.. csv-table:: 
   :header: Client event, Server event, Description
   :widths: 10, 10, 80
   
   :doc:`on_before_scroll </refs/client/item/on_before_scroll>`, :doc:`on_before_scroll </refs/server/item/on_before_scroll>`,  "Occurs before an application scrolls from one record to another."
   :doc:`on_after_scroll </refs/client/item/on_after_scroll>`, :doc:`on_after_scroll </refs/server/item/on_after_scroll>`,  "Occurs after an application scrolls from one record to another."

Using this methods we can navigate a dataset. For example,

on the client:

.. code-block:: js

    function get_customers(customers) {
        customers.open();
        while (!customers.eof()) {
            console.log(customers.firstname.value, customers.lastname.value);
            customers.next();
        }
    }
    
on the server:

.. code-block:: py

    def get_customers(customers):
        customers.open()
        while not customers.eof():
            print customers.firstname.value, customers.lastname.value
            customers.next()

Shorter ways to navigate dataset
================================

There is the :doc:`each </refs/client/item/m_each>` method on the client that can 
be used to navigate a dataset:

For example:

.. code-block:: js

    function get_customers(customers) {
        customers.open();
        customers.each(function(c) {
            if (c.rec_no === 10) {
                return false;
            }
            console.log(c.rec_no, c.firstname.value, c.lastname.value);
        });
    }

On the server we can iterate dataset rows the following way:

.. code-block:: py

    def get_customers(customers):
        customers.open()
        for c in customers:
            if c.rec_no == 10:
                break
            print c.firstname.value, c.lastname.value

Both functions will output customer names for the first 10 records in the dataset.

In both cases the **c** and **customers** are pointers to the same object.
