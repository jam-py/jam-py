Details
=======

Details are used in the framework to work with tabular data, pertaining to a record 
in an item's table.

For example, the **Invoices** journal in the Demo application has the 
**InvoiceTable** detail, which keeps a list of tracks in an customer's invoice.

Details and tables share the same underlying database table.
 
To create a detail, you must first create a table and the use the
:doc:`Details Dialog </admin/items/details_dialog>`
to add a detail to an item.

For example the following code

.. code-block:: py

    def on_created(task):
        task.invoice_table.open()
        print  task.invoice_table.record_count()
    
        task.invoices.open(limit=1)
            task.invoices.invoice_table.open()	
        print task.invoices.invoice_table.record_count()
    
will print::

Tables have two 
:doc:`common fields <common_fields>` -
``master_id`` and ``master_rec_id``, that are used to store information about the 
``ID`` (each item have its own unique ID) and the value of ``id`` field of the 
record of its master. This way each table can be linked to several items. As well
as each item can have several details. To get access to details of an item use
its ``details`` attribute. To get access to the master of the detail use its 
``master`` attribute.

Detail class, used to create details, is an ancestor of the Item class and 
inherits all its attributes, methods and events.

.. note::

    The ``apply`` method of the Detail class does nothing. To write changes made 
    to a detail use ``apply`` method of its master.
    
    To work with a detail its muster must be active
    
    To make any changes to a detail its master must be in an edit or insert mode
    
Examples
========

In this example from the client module of the **Invoices** item of 
:doc:`Demo project </intro/demo_project>`, the **Invoice_table** detail is 
reopened every time the cursor of its master moves to another record.

.. code-block:: js

    var ScrollTimeOut;
    
    function on_after_scroll(item) {
        clearTimeout(ScrollTimeOut);
        ScrollTimeOut = setTimeout(
            function() {
                item.invoice_table.open(function() {});
            },
            100
        );
    }

And just as an example:

.. code-block:: py

    from datetime import datetime, timedelta

    def on_created(task):
        invoices = task.invoices.copy()
        invoices.set_where(invoicedate__gt=datetime.now()-timedelta(days=1))
        invoices.open()
        for i in invoices:
            i.invoice_table.open()
            i.edit()
            for t in i.invoice_table:
                t.edit()
                t.sales_id.value = '101010'
                t.post()
            i.post()
        invoices.apply()
    
The same code on the client will be as follows:

.. code-block:: js

    function on_page_loaded(task) {
        var date = new Date(),
            invoices = task.invoices.copy();
        
        invoices.set_where({invoicedate__gt: date.setDate(date.getDate() - 1)});
        invoices.open();
        invoices.each(function(i) {
            i.invoice_table.open();
            i.edit();
            i.invoice_table.each(function(t) {
                t.edit();
                t.sales_id.value = '101010';
                t.post();
            });
            i.post();
        });
        invoices.apply();
    }
