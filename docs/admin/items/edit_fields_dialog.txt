Edit Fields Dialog
==================

The **Edit Fields Dialog** opens when a developer selects the item in the 
Administrator (see 
:doc:`Items <index>`
) and clicks on the **Edit** button to set the fields to be 
displayed in edit forms on the client and their order. These fields are used by 
default by the
:doc:`create_inputs </refs/client/item/m_create_inputs>`
method, if its **fields** parameter is not specified.
