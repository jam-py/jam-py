===================
Report Group Editor
===================

**Report Group Editor** opens when a developer wants to create a new report group 
or modify an existing one. See 
:doc:`Task tree </programming/task_tree>`

The upper part of the **Report Group Editor** have the following fields:

* **Caption** - the group name that appears to users.

* **Name** - the name of the group that will be used in programming code to 
  get access to the group object. It should be unique in the project and should 
  be a valid python identifier.

* **Visible** - use this checkbox to set group's visible attribute. The value of 
  this attribute can be used in code on the client to create menu items and so 
  on.

In the bottom-right corner of the Dialog form there are two buttons:

* **OK** - click this button to save change you made. 

* **Cancel** - click this buttons to cancel the operation.
