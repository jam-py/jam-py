* **Safe mode** - If safe mode is enabled, authentication  is needed for user to 
  work in the system (See 
  :doc:`Users </admin/users>`
  and 
  :doc:`Roles </admin/roles>`
  ). 
  
* **Debugging** - If this button is checked, the Werkzeug libarary bebugger will
  be invoked when an error on the server occurs.
  
* **Connection pool size** — the size of the server database connection pool. 

* **Multiprocessing connection pool** - if this checkbox is checked the framework 
  creates connection pool by using multiprocessing python module - the 
  connections will be created in different processes.
  
* **Persistent connection** - if this checkbox is checked and multiprocessing 
  connection pool is selected, the framework creates connection in the main 
  process. Before executing any statement, the framework checks if this 
  connection is busy, if not, the statment is executed by this connection, 
  otherwise multiprocessing connection pool is used.
  
* **Compressed JS, CSS files** - If this button is checked the server returns 
  compressed *js* and *css* files when *index.html* page is loaded.

* **All JS modules in a single file** - If this checkbox is unchecked, the 
  application will generate a javascript file in the project *js* folder for 
  every item in the :doc:`task tree </programming/task_tree>`, that has code in
  its Client module, with the name *item_name.js*, where *item_name* is the name 
  of an item. 
  Otherwise, the application will generate a javascript file with the name 
  *task_name.js*, where *task_name* is the name of the project 
  :doc:`task </admin/task>` (for example *demo.js*), that will contain javascript
  code of all items, except items, whose **External js module** checkbox in the 
  :doc:`Item Editor Dialog </admin/items/item_editor_dialog>`
  is checked (separate files will be created for them). 
  
* **Dynamic JS modules loading** - If this checkbox is unchecked and the 
  application generates more than one javascript file, only file named 
  *task_name.js* will be loaded when application is run. All other files must be 
  loaded dynamically. See :doc:`Working with modules </programming/modules>`.
  
* **Version** — specify the version of the project here.

.. note::
   When **Connection pool size**, **Multiprocessing connection pool** or
   **Persistent connection** parameters are changed, the server applicaton must be 
   restarted for changes to take effect.
