Jam.py delpoyment with Apache and mod_wsgi
==========================================

Once you’ve got ``mod_wsgi`` installed and activated, edit your Apache server’s 
httpd.conf file and add the following. If you are using a version of Apache older 
than 2.4, replace **Require all granted** with **Allow from all** and also add 
the line **Order deny,allow** above it.

.. code-block:: apache

    WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/mysite.com/mysite/wsgi.py
    WSGIPythonPath /path/to/mysite.com

    <Directory /path/to/mysite.com/mysite>
    <Files wsgi.py>
    Require all granted
    </Files>
    </Directory>
    
    Alias /static/ /path/to/mysite.com/static/

    <Directory /path/to/mysite.com/static>
    Require all granted
    </Directory>
    

The first bit in the ``WSGIScriptAlias`` line is the base URL path you want to
serve your application at (``/`` indicates the root url), and the second is the
location of a "WSGI file" -- see below -- on your system, usually inside of
your project package (``mysite`` in this example). This tells Apache to serve
any request below the given URL using the WSGI application defined in that
file.

The ``WSGIPythonPath`` line ensures that your project package is available for
import on the Python path; in other words, that ``import mysite`` works.

The ``<Directory>`` piece just ensures that Apache can access your
:file:`wsgi.py` file.

The next lines ensure that anything in the ``/static/`` URL space is explicitly 
served as a static files.

.. note::
	Please note that if the server runs on Windows the **Multiprocessing 
	connection pool** flag in the 
	:doc:`Project Parameters </admin/project/parameters>`
	must be turned off.
