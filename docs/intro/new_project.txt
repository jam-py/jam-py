==================
Creating a project
==================

Create a new directory. 

Go into the directory and run from command line:

.. code-block:: console

    $ jam-project.py


The following files and folders will be created in the directory::

    /
        css/
            project.css
        js/
        img/
        reports/
        static/
        admin.sqlite
        server.py
        index.html


To start Jam.py web server run **server.py** script.


.. code-block:: console

    $ ./server.py


.. note::
    You can specify a port as parameter, for example 
    
    .. code-block:: console
    
        $ ./server.py 8081. 
        
    By default, the port is 8080. If you will specify another port, you need to 
    use it in a browser in the next steps.


Open a Web browser and go to “/admin.html” on your local domain – e.g., 
http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin.html. You should see the select language dialog. 


.. code-block:: console

    127.0.0.1:8080/admin.html
    
    
In the dialog that will appear, select the language and press OK button.

In the New project dialog box fill in:

* **Caption** - the project name that appears to users
* **Name** - name of project (task) that will be used in programming code to 
  get access to the task object. Should be a short valid python identifier. 
* **DB type** — select database type. If database is not Sqlite, it must be 
  created in advance and its attributes should be entered in the 
  corresponding form fields.

When you press OK, the connection to the database will be checked, and in case 
of failure 	an error message will be displayed.

.. note::

    Please note the following requirements:
    
    * to use FireBird database, the python fdb library must be installed 
    * PostgreSQL requires psycopg2 library 
    * MySQL requires MySQLdb library
    * Oracle requires cx_Oracle library     
    * to generate reports LibreOffice must be installed
    
If all goes well a new project will be created and a project tree will appear in 
Administrator.

Now to see the project itself create new page in the browser and type in
the addres bar:
   
.. code-block:: console

    127.0.0.1:8080


.. image:: _images/project.png
