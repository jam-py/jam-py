Package installation

Installing an official release with `pip`
===========================================

This is the recommended way to install Jam.py.

1. Install pip_. The easiest is to use the `standalone pip installer`_. If your
   distribution already has ``pip`` installed, you might need to update it if
   it's outdated. (If it's outdated, you'll know because installation won't
   work.)

2. If you're using Linux, Mac OS X or some other flavor of Unix, enter the
   command ``sudo pip install jam.py`` at the shell prompt. If you're using
   Windows, start a command shell with administrator privileges and run
   the command ``pip install jam.py``. This will install Jam.py in your Python
   installation's ``site-packages`` directory.

Installing an official release manually
=======================================

1. Download the package archive. 

2. Create a new directory and unpack the archive there. 

3. Go into the directory and run the setup command from command line

.. code-block:: console

   $ python setup.py install
    
This will install Jam.py in your Python installation’s site-packages directory.

.. note::
	on some unix like systems you may need to switch to root or run: 
	sudo python setup.py install
