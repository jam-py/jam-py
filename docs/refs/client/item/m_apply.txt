Description
===========

Sends all updated, inserted, and deleted records from the item dataset to the 
application server for writing to the database.

The ``apply`` method can have the following parameters:

* ``callback``: if the parameter is not present, the request to the server is 
  sent synchronously, otherwise, the request is executed asynchronously and 
  after the responce is received, the callback is executed

* ``params`` - an object specifying user defined params, that can be used 
  on the server in the
  :doc:`on_apply </refs/server/item/on_apply>`
  event handler for some additional processing
  
The order of parameters doesn't matter.

The ``apply`` method

* checks whether the item is a detail, and if it is, returns 

* checks whether the item is in edit or insert 
  :doc:`state <at_item_state>`
  , and if so, posts the record
  
* checks if the change log has changes, and if not, returns

* triggers the 
  :doc:`on_before_apply <on_before_apply>`
  event handler if one is defined for the item 

* sends changes to the server 

* server on receiving the request checks whether
  :doc:`on_apply </refs/server/item/on_apply>`
  event handler is defined for the item, and if it is, executes it, otherwise   
  generates and executes SQL query to write changes to the database
  
* when generating an SQL query, check whether a user, that send the request, has 
  rights to make these changes, if not raises an exception
  
* writes changes to the database  
  
* after writing changes to the database, server sends to to the client results
  of the execution
  
* the client, based on the results, updates the change log   

* triggers the 
  :doc:`on_after_apply <on_after_apply>`
  event handler if one is defined for the item 

.. note::
    The server, before writing new records to the database table, generates 
    values for the ``id`` fields. The client updates these fields, based on 
    information received from the server. If you change values of some other 
    fields in the 
    :doc:`on_apply </refs/server/item/on_apply>`
    event handler, these changes will not be reflected on the client. You must
    update them yourself.
