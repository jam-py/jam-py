If you are not a professional programmer or an expert in databases, you can use
Jam.py to store, share and analyze your data.

Please watch these videos to see how easy it is to create and setup Jam.py
applications.

* `Setting up interface of Jam.py application using Forms Dialogs <https://youtu.be/hvNZ0-a_HHw>`_

If you are a professional, you can use Jam.py to create various tools, dashboards,
as well as large-scale business applications with complex internal logic.
Please watch the
`Jam.py framework applications <https://youtu.be/qkJvGlgoabU>`_  video
to see some applications written in Jam.py.

Main features
=============

Jam.py is an object oriented, event driven framework with hierarchical structure, modular design
and very tight DB/GUI coupling. The server side of Jam.py is written in `Python <https://www.python.org">`_,
the client utilizes `JavaScript <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript">`_,
`jQuery <https://jquery.com">`_ and `Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2">`_.

* Simple, clear and efficient IDE. The development takes place in the
  Application builder, an application written completely in Jam.py.

* “All in the browser” framework. With Jam.py, all you need are two pages
  in the browser, one for the project, the other for the Application builder.
  Make changes in the Application builder, go to the project, refresh the page,
  and see the results.

* Supports SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebird, MSSQL and
  Oracle databases. The concept of the framework allows you to migrate from
  one database to another without changing the project.

* Authentication, authorization, session management, roles and permissions.

* Automatic creation and modification of database tables and SQL queries generation.

* Data-aware controls.

* Open framework. You can use any Javascript/Python libraries.

* Rich, informative reports. Band-oriented report generation based on
  `LibreOffice <https://www.libreoffice.org/">`_ templates.

* Charts. You can use free `jsCharts <http://www.jscharts.com/>`_ library
  or any javascript charting library to create charts to represent and analyze your application data.

* Allows to save audit trail/change history made by users

* Predifined css themes.

* Develop and test locally update remotely. Jam.py has Export and Import
  utilities that allow developer to store all metadata (database structures,
  project parameters and code) in a file that can be loaded by another
  application to apply all the changes.
