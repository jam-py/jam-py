Make a stunning database apps for your business really fast, for **free**. Here is the Demo for **Heroku** which you can access from:

https://jampy.herokuapp.com/

With Jam.py you can create, customise, test and share awesome, fast, event-driven applications for SQLite, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Firebird. All of that for free and no vendor lock-in!

How was the Demo published on Heroku?
------------------------------------
The Jam.py Demo you see on Heroku is just a Git repo made from the original Jam.py Demo with two files added: requirements.txt and Procfile.

Then the Heroku account was open, jampy App created, Git repo linked and deployed. In 10 seconds it magically appeared as a live Web site. Enjoy.


Why using Jam.py?
------------------------------------
DRY principle! Don't repeat yourself, do it once, do it well.

With Jam.py Application Builder, you can resolve a specific business problem. Out of the box Jam is providing: fast access to underlying databases, security, authentication, validation, calendars, multi languages, all of that with minimum of coding needed. Being Python framework, it is extensible and flexible.

**“All in the browser” framework**
* Internet Browser IDE
* Code Editor with Syntax Highlighting and Code Completion
* No declarative options, you are in charge.
* Instant WYSIWYG
* Application lifecycle tracking.
* SQL and stored procedures supported for major vendors.
* Integrate any Python library with no contract lock-in and reduce cost instantly.
* Bootstrap, JQuery, JS, all in here. Use it with no fuss and learning this massive libraries.
* Create rich, informative reports, due to band-oriented report generation based on LibreOffice templates.

**Event driven grids**

* Event driven grids enable you to easily manipulate data simply by clicking on a cell and editing its value.
* Event driven data-aware visual interface controls makes the framework flexible and powerful.
* Edit your data in the grid, as you would in any Desktop spreadsheet application.
* Create the master-detail table with breeze, utilising templates for displaying, which is no more than a copy/paste. Easy. * Again, no declarative methods, the control is with you as it should be.

**jsCharts or any charting libraries**

* Locked-in with a vendor charting capabilities? Never again. Use free libraries as jsChart, at.al.
* Use the same charting capabilities on your mobile devices, once for all.
* Visualise charts immediately after you create/import tables, with a few lines of code. Simple and effective.
* Analyzing/displaying BIG data? Add free Python lib's, build a Jam Web Form with parameters, execute on the server. 
* Profit.
